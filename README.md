# Avalanche Analysis
Final project analysis of Avalanche data

# First Segment: Sketch It Out

## Communication Protocol:
In order to complete this analysis, we as a team have a communication plan the following: 

1. Attending in class session times via zoom, including Saturday office hours if needed.
2. Utilizing slack to share updates or ask quick questions.
3. If more time together to problem solve is needed, planned zoom meetings. 

Square: Lindsey is the team member in the square role responsible for the repository.

Triangle: Maya is the member in the triangle role who created a mockup of a machine learning model. Diagram that explains how it will work concurrently with the rest of the project steps.

Circle: Rylee and Meredith are the members in the circle role who created a mockup of a database with a set of the avalanche data. This will ensure the database will work seamlessly with the rest of the project.

X: All team members have decided what technologies will be used for each step of the project 

## Overview of the Analysis:

The framework for this project was to analyze avalanche data from Snowbound Solutions LLC based out of Boise, ID and present our findings to the owner, Scott. This data was presented to us from Scott who is a family friend of Rylee's. As seen in our converted and cleaned avalanche_data.csv file, observations range from November 2015 to December of 2021 and include observation location with various weather parameters noted as well as a hazard score. We realize that although predicting natural phenomenons are relatively difficult, this analysis might help answer a key question: Based on weather conditions, what is the probability of an avalanche occurring? 

# Second Segment: Build the Pieces

## Resources:

Converted the provided Json files from Snowbound Solutions LLC into CSV files 

Database: Postgres SQL

Machine Learning: Supervised Model

Coding: Python - Pandas

Visualization: Tableau

## Purpose:

Analysing weather conditions are a critical piece of information for building avalanche forecasts or assessing avalanche hazard for a specific geographic areas. Historically avalanches pose a threat to anyone on snowy mountainsides and can be deadly because of their intensity and seeming unpredictability. By taking the data over the course of several years and multiple areas and examine weather conditions during past avalanches we can predict the probabilty of an avalanche occurring again based on those factors.
