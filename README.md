# Avalanche Analysis
Final project analysis of Avalanche data

# First Segment: Sketch It Out

## Overview of the Analysis:

The framework for this project was to analyze avalanche data from Snowbound Solutions LLC based out of Boise, ID and present our findings to the owner, Scott. This data was presented to us from Scott who is a family friend of Rylee's. As seen in our converted and cleaned avalanche_data.csv file, observations range from November 2015 to December of 2021 and include different observation locations in Juneau, Alaska with various weather parameters noted as well as a hazard score. 

We realize that although predicting natural phenomenons are relatively difficult, this analysis might help answer a key question: What weather features contribute most to Avalanche occurances in Juneau, Alaska?

# Second Segment: Build the Pieces

## Resources:

## Machine Learning Model

### Description of preliminary data preprocessing

### Description of preliminary feature engineering and preliminary feature selection, including the decision-making process

### Description of how data was split into training and testing sets

### Explanation of model choice, including limitations and benefits


## Purpose:

Analysing weather conditions are a critical piece of information for building avalanche forecasts or assessing avalanche hazard for a specific geographic areas. Historically avalanches pose a threat to anyone on snowy mountainsides and can be deadly because of their intensity and seeming unpredictability. By taking the data over the course of several years and multiple areas in Alaska and examine weather conditions during past avalanches we can predict what weather features increase the hazard of an avalanche occurring again based on those factors.
